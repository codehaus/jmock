        <h1>Comparing jMock and Dynamock</h1>
        <p>jMock was born as a fork of DynaMock, the dynamic mock object
implementation from <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/">mockobjects.com</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">1</sup>.  Initially we wanted
to clean up the code, fix some omissions in the API and make an
honest-to-goodness 1.0 release that guaranteed API stability.  In the end we
produced a significantly different API that encapsulates the lessons we have
learned about unit testing with mock objects.</p>
        <p>What are the main differences that a DynaMock user will notice when they
start using jMock?</p>
        <h2>jMock Has a "Call-Chain" API Syntax</h2>
        <p>The DynaMock API had many methods for defining stubs and expectations:
<code>expect</code>, <code>expectAndReturn</code>,
<code>expectAndThrow</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>matchAndReturn</code>
and <code>matchAndThrow</code>. The jMock API has two methods,
<code>expect</code> and <code>stub</code> that return a builder object with
methods for specifying the method that is expected or stubbed.  Those methods
also return builder objects with methods that return builder objects, and so
on.  The chain of builders enforces a common order in which expectations are
specified, which makes it easier to skim-read tests with mock objects.  The
call chain also makes expectations more descriptive, and so it is easier to
understand what an expectation means.</p>
        <p/>
        <div class="Source Java DynaMock">
<pre>mock.expectAndReturn( "method1", a, result1 );
mock.matchAndReturn( "method2", C.eq(b1,b2), result2 );</pre>
</div>
        <div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(once()).method("method1").with(eq(a))
    .will(returnValue(result1));
mock.stubs().method("method2").with(eq(b1),eq(b2))
    .will(returnValue(result2));</pre>
</div>
        <p>The jMock API needs a bit more typing, but is easier to read, is more
explicit about what it specifies and, a big benefit for us, is much easier to
maintain and extend because there are far fewer methods that must be
overloaded for Java's primitive types.</p>
        <h2>jMock Forces the User to be Explicit</h2>
        <p>The DynaMock API implied information that the user did not explicitly
specify. For example, passing no information about arguments to
<code>expectAndReturn</code> (and related methods) implied that the expected
method had no arguments, passing a value to <code>expectAndReturn</code>
instead of a constraint implied that the actual value should be equal to the
value given, and so on. Although intended to help slothful programmers, this
feature was very confusing in practice. The maintainers of DynaMock often
received support requests that were caused by a misunderstanding of exactly
what was implied by eliding arguments from an an API call.</p>
        <p>The jMock API requires that the user explicitly specify expectations and
constraints.  This makes tests much easier to read.  We have not found that
the additional typing required is a problem in practice.</p>
        <div class="Source Java DynaMock">
<pre>// Does this expect a method with no arguments?  Or ignore the arguments altogether?
mock.expectAndReturn( "methodName", result1 );

// Should the actual argument be the same object as 'arg', or an object equal to 'arg'?
mock.expectAndReturn( "methodName", arg, result2 );</pre>
</div>
        <div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(once()).method("methodName").noParams()
    .will(returnValue(result1));
mock.expects(once()).method("methodName").with(eq(arg))
    .will(returnValue(result2));</pre>
</div>
        <h2>jMock Allows Different Kinds of Expectation</h2>
        <p>A DynaMock expectation requires the expected method to be called once and
only once.  We sometimes want to specify that a method must be called at
least once. Implementing this in DynaMock made the number of overloaded
methods get completely out of hand.  At-least-once expectations are supported
by jMock API. If necessary, the user can even add new kinds of expectation
without changing jMock itself.</p>
        <div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(atLeastOnce()).method("methodName").with(eq(argument))
    .will(returnValue(resultValue));</pre>
</div>
        <h2>jMock Allows Flexible Constraints on the Order of Invocations</h2>
        <p>DynaMock supports ordered and unordered mock objects.  Ordered mock
objects expect calls in a strict order; unordered mocks allow them to happen
in any order. DynaMock does not support anything between these two
extremes.</p>
        <p>jMock, on the other hand, has a very flexible way of specifying how calls
are ordered. If call <var>B</var> must occur after call <var>A</var>, the
user must first give call <var>A</var> an identifier.  They can then specify
that call <var>B</var> must occur after <var>A</var>, using the identifier
they assigned to <var>A</var>. Ordering constraints can be applied to
expectations or stubs, and multiple ordering constraints can be defned on the
same call. This allows a range of ordering constraints to be specified,
including partial ordering of calls.</p>
        <p>In the example below, <code>methodA</code> must be called before
<code>methodB</code> and <code>methodC</code>, but <code>methodB</code> and
<code>methodC</code> can occur in any order:</p>
        <div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(once()).method("methodA").noParams()
    .id("first call to methodA");
mock.expects(once()).method("methodB").noParams()
    .after("first call to methodA");
mock.expects(once()).method("methodC").noParams()
    .after("first call to methodA");</pre>
</div>
        <p>Even better, jMock can define ordering constraints over method calls to
<em>different</em> mocks:</p>
        <div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock1.expects(once()).method("methodA").noParams()
    .id("first call to methodA");
mock2.expects(once()).method("methodB").noParams()
    .after(mock1,"first call to methodA");</pre>
</div>
        <h2>jMock Puts Support Functions in a Test Case Base Class</h2>
        <p>DynaMock uses a class named <code>C</code> to hold support functions that
help set up expectations on a mock.  This led to ugly code and was not easy
to extend.  jMock implements support functions in a test case class,
<code>MockObjectTestCase</code> that the user must extend when they use mock
objects in their tests. This has both advantages and disadvantages. It means
that the support functions can be seamlessly extended by the user by writing
new functions in their own class (see below).  It also lets the test case
automatically verify mock objects (also see below).  However, thanks to
Java's single inheritance of classes, the user cannot inherit support
functions from more than one test case superclass.</p>
        <div class="Source Java DynaMock">
<pre>import junit.framework.TestCase;
import com.mockobjects.dynamic.Mock;

class MyTestCase extends TestCase {
    public void testSomething() {
        Mock mock = new Mock(MyInterface.class);
                
        mock.expectAndReturn( "set", C.args(C.eq("key"),C.eq("value")), "oldValue" );
        
        ...
    }
}</pre>
</div>
        <div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>import org.jmock.MockObjectTestCase;
import org.jmock.Mock;

class MyTestCase extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testSomething() {
        Mock mock = new Mock(MyInterface.class);
                
        mock.expects(once()).method("set").with(eq("key"),eq("value"))
            .will(returnValue("oldValue"));
        ...
    }
}</pre>
</div>
        <h2>jMock Can Automatically Verify Mock Objects</h2>
        <p>The <code>MockObjectTestCase</code> class automatically verifies any
<code>Verifiable</code> objects stored in its instance variables.  This helps
the user avoid common errors caused by forgetting a verify statement. This
automatic verification can be overridden if necessary.  It is actually
defined by the <code>VerifyingTestCase</code> so that it can be reused by
other sugary APIs that need different support functions from the jMock
API.</p>
        <h2>jMock is Easy to Extend</h2>
        <p>DynaMock allowed the user to create new constraint types and seamlessly
use them in DynaMock tests.  Adding new stubs was possible but ugly.  New
expectation types were not supported at all. jMock is much easier to extend:
the user can seamlessly add new types of constraint, expectation, matcher,
and stub.</p>
        <p>Under the hood, jMock has a layered architecture.  The "jMock API" that is
used in unit tests is a thin layer of syntactic sugar on top of a flexible
but inconvenient "core API". The core API can be used to extend the sugary
API, or even replace it completely. For example, an optional extension uses
the core API to make jMock use <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/">CGLIB</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">2</sup> so that tests can mock
concrete classes. The core API has also been used to write an API very
similar to that of <a href="http://www.easymock.org/">EasyMock</a><sup class="LinkFootnoteRef">3</sup>.</p>
