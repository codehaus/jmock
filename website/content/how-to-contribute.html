<h1>How to Contribute to jMock</h1>

<p>jMock is nothing without contributions from the user community. There are
many ways to contribute. We are constantly working on the software and
documentation, so it's a good idea to contact the team on the <a
href="mailing-lists.html">user or development mailing lists</a> to avoid
duplicating effort.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>One of the traditional weak points of open source software is the
documentation. Any help with this aspect of the project will be warmly
welcomed with open arms.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>We are working on one or two examples of using jMock, but we can always do
with more. A user who does a lot of servlet development will not find a J2ME
example useful, and vice versa.</p>

<h2 id="feature-requests">Feature Requests</h2>

<p>We eat our own dogfood, but we're also happy to feed other people's dogs
(if you'll excuse a stretched metaphor). If you want to request a new feature
you can either make a request through the <a
href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10336">issue
tracker</a> or by sending a message to the <a
href="mailing-lists.html">development mailing list</a>. The benefit of any
new features will be discussed on the mailing list, so its a good idea to
sign up so that you can join in the discussion.</p>

<h2 id="bug-reports">Bug Reports</h2>

<p>You can report bugs through the <a
href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10336">issue
tracker</a> interface or the <a href="mailing-lists.html">development mailing
list</a>. Additional brownie points are awarded for bug reports that include
a failing unit test.</p>

<h2 id="patches">Bug Fixes</h2>

<p>If you want <em>lots</em> of brownie points, send a fix along with your
bug report and failing unit test. Bug fixes are best sent as patches that we
can apply to the codebase. Please tell us which version the patch should be
applied against. To be accepted into the codebase, patches must be released
under the <a href="license.html">same license as jMock itself</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-code">New Code</h2>

<p>If you have a new feature request, then we'll listen extra hard if you
show us how it works. A new feature might be best implemented as a patch to
an existing class or as a new class. The jMock API contains many extension
points that allow new functionality to be integrated into the framework. We
are rather fanatical about testing, so if you send us some code without any
tests we will probably ask you to write the tests as well before we add it to
the codebase.</p>

<h2 id="your-own-extension">Write Your Own jMock Extension</h2>

<p>If you have a project that builds upon jMock we will be happy to announce
your project on the jMock site.</p>
