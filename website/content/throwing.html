<h1>Throwing Exceptions from Mocked Methods</h1>

<p>Use the throwException action to throw an exception from a mocked
method.</p>
<pre class="Java Source">allowing (bank).withdraw(with(any(Money.class))); 
    will(throwException(new WithdrawalLimitReachedException());</pre>

<p>JMock will detect if you try to throw a checked exception that is
incompatible with the invoked method and fail the test with a descriptive
error message. It allows you to throw any RuntimeException or Error from any
method.</p>
<pre class="Java Source">allowing (bank).withdraw(Money.ZERO); 
    will(throwException(new IllegalArgumentException("you cannot withdraw nothing!");</pre>
