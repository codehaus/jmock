<h1>The jMock Release Process</h1>

<p>Releasing is pretty automated but there are still some automated steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tag a release using the format V1_2_3_RC4 where, in this case, 1 is the
    major version, 2 is the minor version and 3 is the patch number and 4 is
    the release candidate number. The trailing _RC4 is optional. I usually
    use Eclipse for this because it makes it really easy.</li>
  <li>Run the release script: ./release.sh 1.2.3-RC4. Again the "-RC4" is
    optional. That will publish the zips and javadoc. Zips are published
    under <tt><a
    href="http://www.jmock.org/dist">http://www.jmock.org/dist</a></tt>,
    javadoc under <tt><a
    href="http://www.jmock.org/javadoc/">http://www.jmock.org/javadoc/</a></tt>.</li>
  <li>Update the website. This is currently entirely manual and needs to be
    more automatic. 
    <ol>
      <li>Check out the <tt>website</tt> module from CVS</li>
      <li>Edit the appropriate versions file in the data directory to record
        the latest stable or prerelease version.</li>
      <li>Update the <tt>content/download.html</tt> document to link to the
        released JARs</li>
      <li>Update the <tt>content/javadoc.html</tt> document to link to the
        released Javadoc.</li>
      <li>Update the <tt>content/news-rss2.xml</tt> file to announce the new
        release.</li>
      <li>Run <kbd>make</kbd> to build a local copy. Check that it all looks
        ok by opening <tt>skinned/index.html</tt> and browsing the download
        and javadoc pages.</li>
      <li>Run <kbd>make published</kbd> to publish the updated website.</li>
      <li>Commit the website changes to CVS.</li>
      <li>Add the new version to the list of jMock versions in JIRA (if it
        doesn't already exist) and mark it as released on the current
      date.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
