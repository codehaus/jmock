<h1>Matchers</h1>

<p>Most of the time you can define expectations by specifying literal
parameter values that are compared for equality against the actual parameters
of invoked methods. For example:</p>
<pre>allowing (calculator).add(2,2); will(returnValue(5));</pre>

<p>Sometimes, however, you will need to define looser constraints over
parameter values to clearly express the intent of the test or to ignore
parameters (or parts of parameters) that are not relevant to the behaviour
being tested.</p>

<p>Expected argument values are defined using "matchers". Matchers are
implemented by the <a href="http://www.hamcrest.org">Hamcrest</a> project,
which is bundled with jMock. Hamcrest provides a set of matchers that are
suitable for almost all tests. These can be combined to tighten or loosen the
specification if necessary. The set of matchers is <a
href="custom-matchers.html">extensible</a> so you can write new matchers to
cover unusual testing scenarios.</p>

<p>Matchers are specified by calling "syntactic sugar" methods of Hamcrest's
<code>Matchers</code> class. Typically you will statically import these into
your test code. This recipe describes the matchers that are most commonly
used in jMock tests.</p>

<h2>Basic Matchers</h2>

<h3>Object Equality</h3>

<p>The most commonly used matcher is <code>equalTo</code>, which specifies
that the received argument must be equal to a given value. The code below,
for example, specifies that the method "m" must be called with one argument
of value 1.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(equalTo(1)));</pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>equal</code> constraint uses the <code>equals</code> method of
the expected value to compare the expected and actual values for equality.
Null values are checked beforehand, so it is safe to specify
<code>equal(null)</code> or apply the matcher to a null actual value. Arrays
are treated as a special case: two arrays are considered equal by
<code>equal</code> if they are the same size and all their elements are
considered equal by <code>equal</code>.</p>

<h3>Numeric Equality with Error Margin</h3>

<p>An overloaded version of the <code>equal</code> constraint specifies
floating point values as equal to another value with some margin of error to
account for rounding error. The following code specifies that the method "m"
will be called with one argument of value 1 plus or minus 0.002.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(equal(1, 0.002)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>Object Identity</h3>

<p>The <code>same</code> matcher specifies that the actual value of the
argument must be the same object as the expected value. This is a tighter
constraint than <code>equal</code>, but is usually what you want for
arguments that pass references to behavioural objects. The following code
specifies that method "m" will be called with one argument that refers to the
same object as <var>expected</var>.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>Object expected = new Object();

one (mock).doSomething(with(same(expected)));</pre>
</div>

<p>As a rule of thumb, use <code>equal</code> for value objects and
<code>same</code> for behavioural objects.</p>

<h3>Instance of a Type</h3>

<p>The <code>instanceOf</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument
must be an instance of the given type. The following code specifies that
method "m" must be called with an argument that is an ActionEvent.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(instanceOf(ActionEvent.class)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>String Contains a Substring</h3>

<p>The <code>stringContaining</code> matcher specifies that the expected
argument must be a string that contains the given substring. The following
code specifies that method "m" must be called with an argument that is a
string containing the text "hello".</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock.doSomething(with(stringContaining("hello")));</pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>stringContaining</code> matcher is especially useful for testing
string contents but isolating tests from the exact details of punctuation and
formatting. For example, the code above would accept any of the following
argument values: "hello world"; "hello, world"; "hello!"; and so on.</p>

<h3>Null or Not Null</h3>

<p>The matchers <code>aNull&lt;T&gt;(Class&lt;T&gt;)</code> and
<code>aNonNull&lt;T&gt;(Class&lt;T&gt;)</code> specify that an argument is
null or is not null, respectively. The following code specifies that method
"doSomething" must be called with two Strings, the first must be null and the
second must not be null.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(aNull(String.class)), aNonNull(String.class)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>Anything</h3>

<p>The <code>any&lt;T&gt;(Class&lt;T&gt;)</code> constraint specifies that
any value of the given type is allowed. This is useful for ignoring arguments
that are not relevant to the scenario being tested. Judicious use of the
<code>any</code> constraint ensure that your tests are flexible and do not
require constant maintenance when tested code changes. The following code
specifies that the method "doSomething" must be called with two arguments,
the first of which is equal to 1 and the second of which is ignored in this
test.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(eq(1)), with(any(String.class)));</pre>
</div>

<h2>Combining Matchers</h2>

<p>Matchers can be composed to create a tighter or looser specification.
Composite matchers are themselves matchers and can therefore be further
composed.</p>

<h3>Not &mdash; Logical Negation</h3>

<p>The <code>not</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument must
<em>not</em> match a given matcher. The following code specifies that the
method "doSomething" must be called with an argument that is not equal to
1.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(not(eq(1)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>AllOf &mdash; Logical Conjunction</h3>

<p>The <code>allOf</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument must
meet <em>all</em> of the matchers given as arguments. The following code
specifies that the method "m" must be called with a string that contains the
text "hello" and the text "world".</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(allOf(stringContaining("hello"),
                                  stringContaining("world"))));</pre>
</div>

<h3>AnyOf &mdash; Logical Disjunction</h3>

<p>The <code>anyOf</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument must
meet <em>at least one</em> of the matchers given as arguments. The following
code specifies that the method "m" must be called with a string that either
contains the text "hello" or the text "howdy".</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(anyOf(stringContains("hello"),
                                  stringContains("howdy"))));</pre>
</div>

<h2>More Matchers</h2>

<p>That covers the important matchers used in jMock tests. Most of your tests
will only need the basic constraints. Sometimes you will have to dig into
Hamcrest's bag of tricks more deeply. You may need to define your own
matchers by composing existing matchers. Occasionally, however, you might
find that no existing matcher exactly meets the need of your test. In these
cases, you will have to extend jMock by <a
href="custom-matchers.html">writing a custom matcher</a>.</p>
