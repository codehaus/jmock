<h1>Matchers</h1>

<p>Most of the time expectations specify literal parameter values that are
compared for equality against the actual parameters of invoked methods. For
example:</p>
<pre class="Java Source">allowing (calculator).add(2,2); will(returnValue(5));</pre>

<p>Sometimes, however, you will need to define looser constraints over
parameter values to clearly express the intent of the test or to ignore
parameters (or parts of parameters) that are not relevant to the behaviour
being tested. For example:</p>
<pre class="Java Source">allowing (calculator).sqrt(with(lessThan(0)); will(throwException(new IllegalArgumentException());
one (log).append(with(equal(Log.ERROR)), with(stringContaining("sqrt"));</pre>

<p>Loose parameter constraints are defined by specifying <em>matchers</em>
for each parameter. Matchers are created by factory methods, such as
<code>lessThan</code>, <code>equal</code> and <code>stringContaining</code>
in the example above, to ensure that the expectation is easy to read. Each
syntactic sugar methods must be wrapped by a call to the <code>with</code>
method.</p>

<p class="Note Information">An expectation that uses parameter matchers must specify a
matcher for <em>every</em> parameter. You cannot mix literal parameter values
and matchers in the same expectation.</p>

<p>Factory methods for commonly used matchers are defined in the Expectations
class. More matchers are defined as static methods in the
<code>org.hamcrest.Matchers</code> class. If you need these, statically
import thse Matchers into your test code:</p>
<pre class="Java Source">import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;</pre>

<p>Matchers can be combined to tighten or loosen the specification if
necessary. The set of matchers is <a
href="custom-matchers.html">extensible</a> so you can write new matchers to
cover unusual testing scenarios.</p>

<h2>Basic Matchers</h2>

<h3>Object Equality</h3>

<p>The most commonly used matcher is <code>equal</code>, which specifies that
the received argument must be equal to a given value. The code below, for
example, specifies that the method "m" must be called with one argument of
value 1.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(equal(1)));</pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>equalTo</code> constraint uses the <code>equals</code> method of
the expected value to compare the expected and actual values for equality.
Null values are checked beforehand, so it is safe to specify
<code>equal(null)</code> or apply the matcher to a null actual value. Arrays
are treated as a special case: two arrays are considered equal if they are
the same size and all their elements are considered equal.</p>

<h3>Object Identity</h3>

<p>The <code>same</code> matcher specifies that the actual value of the
argument must be the same object as the expected value. This is a tighter
constraint than <code>equal</code>, but is usually what you want for
arguments that pass references to behavioural objects. The following code
specifies that method "m" will be called with one argument that refers to the
same object as <var>expected</var>.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>Object expected = new Object();

one (mock).doSomething(with(same(expected)));</pre>
</div>

<p>As a rule of thumb, use <code>equal</code> for value objects and
<code>same</code> for behavioural objects.</p>

<h3>Instance of a Type</h3>

<p>The <code>instanceOf</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument
must be an instance of the given type. The following code specifies that
method "m" must be called with an argument that is an ActionEvent.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(instanceOf(ActionEvent.class)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>Substring</h3>

<p>The <code>stringContaining</code> matcher specifies that the expected
argument must be a string that contains the given substring. The following
code specifies that method "m" must be called with an argument that is a
string containing the text "hello".</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock.doSomething(with(stringContaining("hello")));</pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>stringContaining</code> matcher is especially useful for testing
string contents but isolating tests from the exact details of punctuation and
formatting. For example, the code above would accept any of the following
argument values: "hello world"; "hello, world"; "hello!"; and so on.</p>

<h3>Null or Not Null</h3>

<p>The matchers <code>aNull&lt;T&gt;(Class&lt;T&gt;)</code> and
<code>aNonNull&lt;T&gt;(Class&lt;T&gt;)</code> specify that an argument is
null or is not null, respectively. The following code specifies that method
"doSomething" must be called with two Strings, the first must be null and the
second must not be null.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(aNull(String.class)), aNonNull(String.class)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>Anything</h3>

<p>The <code>any&lt;T&gt;(Class&lt;T&gt;)</code> constraint specifies that
any value of the given type is allowed. This is useful for ignoring arguments
that are not relevant to the scenario being tested. Judicious use of the
<code>any</code> constraint ensure that your tests are flexible and do not
require constant maintenance when tested code changes. The following code
specifies that the method "doSomething" must be called with two arguments,
the first of which is equal to 1 and the second of which is ignored in this
test.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(eq(1)), with(any(String.class)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>Numeric Equality with Error Margin</h3>

<p>An overloaded version of the <code>equal</code> constraint specifies
floating point values as equal to another value with some margin of error to
account for rounding error. The following code specifies that the method "m"
will be called with one argument of value 1 plus or minus 0.002.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(equal(1, 0.002)));</pre>
</div>

<h2>Combining Matchers</h2>

<p>Matchers can be composed to create a tighter or looser specification.
Composite matchers are themselves matchers and can therefore be further
composed.</p>

<h3>Not &mdash; Logical Negation</h3>

<p>The <code>not</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument must
<em>not</em> match a given matcher. The following code specifies that the
method "doSomething" must be called with an argument that is not equal to
1.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(not(eq(1)));</pre>
</div>

<h3>AllOf &mdash; Logical Conjunction</h3>

<p>The <code>allOf</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument must
meet <em>all</em> of the matchers given as arguments. The following code
specifies that the method "m" must be called with a string that contains the
text "hello" and the text "world".</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(allOf(stringContaining("hello"),
                                  stringContaining("world"))));</pre>
</div>

<h3>AnyOf &mdash; Logical Disjunction</h3>

<p>The <code>anyOf</code> matcher specifies that the actual argument must
meet <em>at least one</em> of the matchers given as arguments. The following
code specifies that the method "m" must be called with a string that either
contains the text "hello" or the text "howdy".</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>one (mock).doSomething(with(anyOf(stringContains("hello"),
                                  stringContains("howdy"))));</pre>
