<h1>Upgrading from jMock 1 to jMock 2</h1>

<p>You can add both jMock 1 and jMock 2 JARs to the classpath at the same
time without class names clashing. This allows you to run jMock 1 and 2 tests
simultaneously. You can write new tests with jMock 2 and gradually port older
tests to the new version as you find the need.</p>

<h3>Beware!</h3>

<p>Make sure your test fixture extends the correct base class: extend
<code>org.jmock.MockObjectTestCase</code> in jMock 1 tests and
<code>org.jmock.integration.junit3.MockObjectTestCase</code> in jMock 2
tests.</p>
