Advantages of jMock 2 over jMock 1
----------------------------------

* Uses real method calls, not strings: can refactor more easily and
  autocomplete in the IDE.
* Customisation by delegation, not by inheritance
* Many more plugin-points for customisation
* Independent of any testing framework: compatability with the testing
  framework is a plugin-point.
* Can mock concrete classes *without* calling their constructors (if
  you really want to).
* Uses Hamcrest matchers, so can use a large and ever-growing library
  of matchers in expectations.
