Features planned for post 2.0.0:
================================

- TestNG
    Can't work out how to verify mocks before running tear-down methods.
    Is this possible at all in TestNG?

- Paranamer and OGNL
    An action that can call back to parameters identified by name.
    Maybe an optional plug-in, since some people are uncomfortable about
    the loss of static typing this would introduce.
