Functionality
=============

- How to pass default action to flexible expectations?

- More syntactic sugar (matchers, actions) in OrderingConstraint

- wording of never/allowing/ignoring
   - ignoring in particular is misleading: it doesn't make the mockery
     or expectation group ignore the mock object, it makes it allow any
     method call to the mock object.

- write a test for a()/an()

- pull out a cardinality constraint?


Build
=====

- Run the unit and acceptance tests from the Ant build

- Publish snapshots somewhere


Hamcrest
========

- Comparable seems too complicated. Shouldn't it be a couple of subclasses?
