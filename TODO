Features planned for post 2.0.0:
================================

- TestNG
    Can't work out how to verify mocks before running tear-down methods.
    Is this possible at all in TestNG?

- Objenesis
    Write an Imposteriser that uses Objenesis and CGLIB instead of the
    UnsafeHackConcreteClassImposteriser

- Paranamer and OGNL
    An action that can call back to to parameters identified by name
