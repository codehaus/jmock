*** Suggested improvements ***

(sensible defaults reduce test brittleness)
- Sensible default: When no args specified in Mock, use ANY-args instead of NO-args.
- Sensible default: If no expectation/match setup, invocation should produce no-op instead of fail.
- ExpectNotCalled (or equivalent) makes tests more expressive.
- Extract interface from Invocation.
- Remove deprecated methods in Mock.
- Make it simpler to add custom stubs (for side-effects).
