*** Stuff to do ***

- Setup Jira.
- Update developers/contributors/cvs/mailing-list maven details.
- Find new name for "builder" API

*** Suggested improvements ***

(sensible defaults reduce test brittleness)
- Sensible default: When no args specified in Mock, use ANY-args instead of NO-args.
  -- I disagree: if you allow any arguments, putting C.ANY_ARGS shows what you are doing and isn't
     particularly verbose
- Sensible default: If no expectation/match setup, invocation should produce no-op instead of fail.
- ExpectNotCalled (or equivalent) makes tests more expressive.
- Extract interface from Invocation.
