  	<h1>Comparing jMock and Dynamock</h1>
  	
  	<p>jMock was born as a fork of DynaMock, the dynamic mock object implementation
  	from <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/">mockobjects.com</a>.  Initially we
  	wanted to clean up the code, fix some omissions in the API and make an
  	honest-to-goodness 1.0 release that guaranteed API stability.  In the end we
  	produced a significantly different API that encapsulates the lessons we have
  	learned about unit testing with mock objects.</p>
  	
  	<p>What are the main differences that a DynaMock user will notice when they
  	start using jMock?</p>
  	
  	<h2>jMock Has a &quot;Call-Chain&quot; API Syntax</h2>
  	
  	<p>The DynaMock API had many methods for defining stubs and expectations:
  	<code>expect</code>, <code>expectAndReturn</code>, <code>expectAndThrow</code>,
  	<code>match</code>, <code>matchAndReturn</code> and <code>matchAndThrow</code>.
  	The jMock API has two methods, <code>expect</code> and <code>stub</code> that
  	return a builder object with methods for specifying the method that is expected 
  	or stubbed.  Those methods also return builder objects with methods that return
  	builder objects, and so on.  The chain of builders enforces a common order in
  	which expectations are specified, which makes it easier to skim-read tests
  	with mock objects.  The call chain also makes expectations more descriptive,
  	and so it is easier to understand what an expectation means.<p>
  	
  	</p>Here is an example showing the same expectation set up using the
  	DynaMock and jMock APIs:</p>
  	
  	<div class="Source Java DynaMock">
<pre>mock.expectAndReturn( "method1", a, result1 );
mock.matchAndReturn( "method2", C.eq(b1,b2), result2 );</pre>
  	</div>
	
  	<div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(once()).method("method1").with(eq(a))
    .will(returnValue(result1));
mock.stubs().method("method2").with(eq(b1),eq(b2))
    .will(returnValue(result2));</pre>
  	</div>
  	
  	<p>The jMock API needs a bit more typing, but is easier to read, is more explicit
  	about what it specifies and, a big benefit for us, is much easier to maintain and 
  	extend because there are far fewer methods that must be overloaded for Java's
  	primitive types.</p>
  	
  	<h2>jMock Forces the User to be Explicit</h2>
  	
  	<p>The DynaMock API implied information that the user did not explicitly specify.
  	For example, passing no information about arguments to <code>expectAndReturn</code> 
  	(and related methods) implied that the expected method had no arguments, passing a 
  	value to <code>expectAndReturn</code> instead of a constraint implied that the 
  	actual value should be equal to the value given, and so on.  
  	Although intended to help slothful programmers, this feature was very confusing in 
  	practice.
  	The maintainers of DynaMock often received support requests that were caused by a
  	misunderstanding of exactly what was implied by eliding arguments from an 
  	an API call.</p>
  	
  	<p>The jMock API requires that the user explicitly specify expectations and 
  	constraints.  This makes tests much easier to read.  We have not found that the 
  	additional typing required is a problem in practice.</p>
  	
  	<div class="Source Java DynaMock">
<pre>// Does this expect a method with no arguments?  Or ignore the arguments altogether?
mock.expectAndReturn( "methodName", result1 );

// Should the actual argument be the same object as 'arg', or an object equal to 'arg'?
mock.expectAndReturn( "methodName", arg, result2 );</pre>
  	</div>  	
  	<div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(once()).method("methodName").noParams()
    .will(returnValue(result1));
mock.expects(once()).method("methodName").with(eq(arg))
    .will(returnValue(result2));</pre>
  	</div>  	
  	
  	<h2>jMock Allows Different Kinds of Expectation</h2>
  	
  	<p>A DynaMock expectation requires the expected method to be called once and only 
  	once.  We sometimes want to specify that a method must be called at least once.
  	Implementing this in DynaMock made the number of overloaded methods get 
  	completely out of hand.  At-least-once expectations are supported by jMock API.
  	If necessary, the user can even add new kinds of expectation without changing 
  	jMock itself.</p>
  	
  	<div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(atLeastOnce()).method("methodName").with(eq(argument))
    .will(returnValue(resultValue));</pre>
  	</div>
  	
  	<h2>jMock Allows Flexible Constraints on the Order of Invocations</h2>
  	
  	<p>DynaMock supports ordered and unordered mock objects.  Ordered mock objects
  	expect calls in a strict order; unordered mocks allow them to happen in any order.
  	DynaMock does not support anything between these two extremes.</p>
  	
  	<p>jMock, on the other hand, has a very flexible way of specifying how calls are ordered.
  	If call <var>B</var> must occur after call <var>A</var>, the user must first give
  	call <var>A</var> an identifier.  They can then specify that call <var>B</var> must
  	occur after <var>A</var>, using the identifier they assigned to <var>A</var>.
	Ordering constraints can be applied to expectations or stubs, and 
  	multiple ordering constraints can be defned on the same call.
  	This allows a range of ordering constraints to be specified, including partial 
  	ordering of calls.</p>
  	
  	<p>In the example below, <code>methodA</code> must be called before 
  	<code>methodB</code> and <code>methodC</code>,
  	but <code>methodB</code> and <code>methodC</code> can occur in any order:</p>
  	
  	<div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock.expects(once()).method("methodA").noParams()
    .id("first call to methodA");
mock.expects(once()).method("methodB").noParams()
    .after("first call to methodA");
mock.expects(once()).method("methodC").noParams()
    .after("first call to methodA");</pre>
  	</div>
  	
  	<p>Even better, jMock can define ordering constraints over method calls to 
  	<em>different</em> mocks:</p>
  	
  	<div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>mock1.expects(once()).method("methodA").noParams()
    .id("first call to methodA");
mock2.expects(once()).method("methodB").noParams()
    .after(mock1,"first call to methodA");</pre>
  	</div>
  	
  	<h2>jMock Puts Support Functions in a Test Case Base Class</h2>
  	
  	<p>DynaMock uses a class named <code>C</code> to hold support functions that
  	help set up expectations on a mock.  This led to ugly code and was not easy
  	to extend.  jMock implements support functions in a test case class, 
  	<code>MockObjectTestCase</code> that the user must extend when they use
  	mock objects in their tests.
  	This has both advantages and disadvantages.
  	It means that the support functions can be seamlessly extended by the user
  	by writing new functions in their own class (see below).  It also lets the
  	test case automatically verify mock objects (also see below).  However, thanks
  	to Java's single inheritance of classes, the user cannot inherit support functions
  	from more than one test case superclass.</p>
  	
  	<div class="Source Java DynaMock">
<pre>import junit.framework.TestCase;
import com.mockobjects.dynamic.Mock;

class MyTestCase extends TestCase {
    public void testSomething() {
        Mock mock = new Mock(MyInterface.class);
		
        mock.expectAndReturn( "set", C.args(C.eq("key"),C.eq("value")), "oldValue" );
        
        ...
    }
}</pre>
	</div>

  	<div class="Source Java JMock">
<pre>import org.jmock.MockObjectTestCase;
import org.jmock.Mock;

class MyTestCase extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testSomething() {
        Mock mock = new Mock(MyInterface.class);
		
        mock.expects(once()).method("set").with(eq("key"),eq("value"))
            .will(returnValue("oldValue"));
        ...
    }
}</pre>
  	</div>
  	
  	<h2>jMock Can Automatically Verify Mock Objects</h2>
  	
  	<p>The <code>MockObjectTestCase</code> class automatically verifies any 
  	<code>Verifiable</code> objects stored in its instance variables.  This helps
  	the user avoid common errors caused by forgetting a verify statement.
  	This automatic verification can be overridden if necessary.  It is actually
  	defined by the <code>VerifyingTestCase</code> so that it can be reused by
  	other sugary APIs that need different support functions from the jMock API.</p>
  	
  	<h2>jMock is Easy to Extend</h2>
  	
  	<p>DynaMock allowed the user to create new constraint types and seamlessly use them
  	in DynaMock tests.  Adding new stubs was possible but ugly.  New expectation types 
  	were not supported at all.
  	jMock is much easier to extend: the user can seamlessly add new types of
  	constraint, expectation, matcher, and stub.</p>
  	
  	<p>Under the hood, jMock has a layered architecture.  The "jMock API" that is used
  	in unit tests is a thin layer of syntactic sugar on top of a flexible but inconvenient
  	"core API".
  	The core API can be used to extend the sugary API, or even replace it completely.
  	For example, an optional extension uses the core API to make jMock use
  	<a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/">CGLIB</a> so that tests can mock concrete classes.
  	The core API has also been used to write an API very similar to that of 
  	<a href="http://www.easymock.org/">EasyMock</a>.

  	<!-- not yet!
  	
  	<h2>jMock is at Version 1.0.0</h2>
  	
	<p>DynaMock always had a 0.0.<var>x</var> version number and the API changed significantly
	between releases.  The jMock project has made a 1.0.0 release and follows strict 
	<a href="versioning.html">rules</a> that govern how releases may make changes to the API
	and how those changes are reflected in the version number of each release.</p>
