    <h1>jMock: Yoga for Your Unit Tests</h1>
    
    <p>Brittle tests are a common "gotcha" of test driven development.
    A brittle unit test will stop passing when you make 
    unrelated changes to your application code.  A test suite that
    contains a lot of brittle tests will slow down development and
    inhibit refactoring.</p>
    
    <p>Brittleness results from the test overspecifying the behaviour 
    of the unit being tested.
    You can keep your tests flexible by following a simple rule of thumb: 
    <span class="RuleOfThumb">specify exactly what you want to happen <em>and no more</em></span>.
    This article describes how various features of jMock can help you
    strike the right balance between an accurate specification 
    of a unit's required behaviour and a flexible test that allows easy 
    evolution of the code base.</p>
    
    <h2>Stubs and Expectations</h2>
    
    <p>
    jMock distinguishes between stubbed and expected methods.  A stubbed
    method call can occur during a test run, but if it does not occur 
    the test still passes.  
    An expected method call, on the other hand, <em>must</em> occur 
    during a test run;  
    if it does not occur, the test fails when it verifies the mock.
    When setting up your mocks you must choose whether to stub or expect 
    each invocation.  In general, we have found that tests are kept flexible 
    when we follow this rule of thumb: 
    <span class="RuleOfThumb">stub queries and expect commands</span>,
    where a query is a method with no side effects that does nothing
    but query the state of an object and a command is a method with side
    effects that may, or may not, return a result.
    Of course, this rule does not hold all the time, but it's a useful 
    starting point.
    </p>
    
    <p>A stub can be called any number of times.  The number of times a 
    method is expected is defined by the expectation itself.  
    The <code>once()</code> expectation allows the method to be called
    once only; subsequent calls will make the test fail.
    The <code>atLeastOnce()</code> expectation allows the method to be called
    any number of times.  The test will only fail if the method is never 
    called at all.  
    You can define further expectation types if these are not sufficient
    for your needs.</p>
    
    <p>In the following example, the <code>getLoggingLevel</code> is
    stubbed: it does not have to be called.  
    The <code>setLoggingLevel</code> must be called once and once only.
    </p>
    
    <div class="Source Java">
<pre>
logger.stub().method("getLoggingLevel").noParams()
    .will(returnValue(Logger.WARNING));
logger.expect(once()).method("setLoggingLevel").with(eq(newLevel));
</pre>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Parameter Constraints</h2>
    
    <p>jMock requires that you specify a <i>constraint</i> on each actual
    parameter of a expected invocation, rather than specify just the 
    expected parameter value.  Specifying equality to an expected value 
    is the most common case, but is too strict for many scenarios.
    For example, consider a system that logs errors to a 
    <code>Logger</code> object.
    To test that an object correctly detects and logs an error, such
    as a failed attempt to connect to a database, you could 
    set up an expectation on a mock logger to check the value of the
    message passed to the logger:</p>
    
    <div class="Source Java">
<pre>String expectedErrorMessage = "unable to connect to ORDERS database: network timeout";

logger.expect(once()).method("error").with(eq(expectedErrorMessage));</pre>
    </div>
    
    <p>This will work in the short term, but will cause problems long term 
    because it too precisely specifies the expected value of the error message, 
    including minor details of punctuation and whitespace.  
    If you change that formatting later, the test will fail even though the 
    code under test still does what you want it to do.
    You really only care that the error message contains the information 
    you want to report to the user &mdash; the action that failed and 
    the cause of the failure &mdash; not how that information is formatted.
    You can use the constraint functions defined by the 
    <code>MockObjectTestCase</code> class to specify exactly what you want
    to happen:</p>
    
    <div class="Source Java">
<pre>String action = "connect to ORDERS database";
String cause = "network timeout";

logger.expect(once()).method("error")
    .with( and(stringContains(action),stringContains(cause)) );</pre>
    </div>
    
    <p>The <code>MockObjectTestCase</code> class defines several functions that
    can be used to define constraints.  There are more constraint types
    defined in the 
    <code><a href="docs/javadoc/org/jmock/core/constraint/package-summary.html">org.jmock.constraint</a></code>
    package.  You can even <a href="custom-constraints.html">define your own constraints</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Constraints require you to type a little more when writing your tests, 
    and require you to think more carefully about what behaviour you expect, 
    but the result is that your tests are easier to read because they clearly 
    express your intent and more flexible because they don't overspecify
    expected behaviour.</p>
  
    <h2>Invocation Order</h2>
    
    <p>
    By default, jMock allows invocations upon a mock object to occur in 
    any order.  Sometimes, however, the order of calls is important, such
    as when you are testing an object that fires events or writes data
    to an output stream.
    In such cases you can explicitly specify that a call should occur
    after one or more others.
    </p>
    
    <div class="Source Java">
<pre>logger.expect(once()).method("setLoggingLevel").with(eq(Logger.WARNING))
    .id("warning level set");
logger.expect(once()).method("warn").with(warningMessage)
    .after("warning level set");
logger.stub().method("getLoggingLevel").noParams()
    .after("warning level set").will(returnValue(Logger.WARNING));</pre>
    </div>
    
    <p>A rule of thumb to follow when specifying the expected order
    of method calls is: 
    <span class="RuleOfThumb">test the ordering of <em>only</em> those 
    calls you want to occur in order</span>.
    The example above allows the <code>warn</code> and 
    <code>getLoggingLevel</code>
    methods to occur in any order, as long as they occur after the call to
    <code>setLoggingLevel</code>. Thus we can change the order in which our 
    tested object calls <code>warn</code> and <code>getLoggingLevel</code> 
    without breaking our tests.</p>
    
    <p>Specifying the order of calls is orthogonal to whether those calls are
    expectations or stubs.  So, the example above specifies that the
    <code>getLoggingLevel</code> method does not have to be called, 
    but if it is, it must be called after 
    <code>setLoggingLevel</code>, and that the
    <code>warn</code> method must be called and must be called after
    <code>setLoggingLevel</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>Matchers</h2>
    
    <p>The methods <code>method(</code><var>methodName</var><code>)</code>,
    <code>with(</code><var>argument&nbsp;constraints</var><code>)</code> and
    <code>after(</code><var>prior&nbsp;call&nbsp;ID</var><code>)</code>
    are syntactic sugar that define matching rules that match an incoming invocation
    to an object that can mock the behaviour of the invocation and test its
    expectations.
    If jMock does not have a matching rule that you need, or the matching rules 
    supported by jMock are not accurate enough to keep your tests flexible,
    you can extend jMock with matching rules of your own.</p>
    
    <p>If you need more control over how method names are matched, you can specify
    a constraint over names instead of a precise name value.  An invocation will match 
    if the constraint evaluates to <code>true</code> when applied to the method name.
    Suppose that you want to stub all calls to the property getter methods of a mock object
    by synthesising a default result based on the type of the property.
    You could achieve with a constraint that matches method names that begin with
    &quot;get&quot; and that have no parameters.
    (See <a href="custom-constraints.html">Writing Custom Constraints</a> for the definition
    of the <code>StringStartsWith</code> class).
    </p>
    
    <div class="Source Java">
<pre>...

private DefaultResultStub returnADefaultValue = new DefaultResultStub();
    
public void testMethod() {
    ...
    mock.stub().method(startingWith("get")).noParams().will(returnADefaultValue);
    ...
}

private Constraint startingWith( String prefix ) {
    return new StringStartsWith(prefix);
}

...</pre>
    </div>
    
    <p>This example is, however, still brittle.  You want the mock to stub all property 
    getter methods but that is not actually what the test specifies.  To precisely
    specify the required behaviour you can 
    <a href="custom-matchers.html">write your own matching rule</a> 
    that uses the Java Bean API to test if a method is a property getter.
    </p>
    
    <div class="Source Java">
<pre>...

private DefaultResultStub returnADefaultValue = new DefaultResultStub();

public void testMethod() {
    ...
    mock.stub().match(aBeanPropertyGetter()).will(returnADefaultValue);
    ...
}

private InvocationMatcher aBeanPropertyGetter() {
    return new BeanPropertyGetterMatcher();
}

...
</pre>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>This article should have given you some idea of why the jMock API is designed as it is
    and how that API can help you avoid brittle tests. 
    The most important rule of thumb we follow to keep our tests flexible is:</p>
    
    <blockquote><span class="RuleOfThumb">Specify exactly what you want to happen <em>and no more</em>.</span></blockquote>
    
    <p>This guideline is just as applicable when writing unit tests that do not use mock 
    objects.</p>
