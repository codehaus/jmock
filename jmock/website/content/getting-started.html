<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This guide assumes you are familiar with unit-testing and <a
href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a>.</p>

<p>For a simple example we are going to test a publish/subscribe message
system. A Publisher sends objects to zero or more Subscribers.  We want to
test the Publisher, which involves testing its interactions with its
Subscribers.</p>

<p>The Subscriber interface looks like this:</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>interface Subscriber {
    void receive(String message);
}</pre>
</div>

<p>We will test that a Publisher sends a message to a single registered
Subscriber. To test interactions between the Publisher and the Subscriber we
will use a mock Subscriber object.</p>

<p>First we must import the jMock classes, define our test fixture class and
define a test case method.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>import org.jmock.*;

class PublisherTest extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testOneSubscriberReceivesAMessage() {
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>We will now write the body of the
<code>testOneSubscriberReceivesAMessage</code> method.</p>

<p>We first <i>set up</i> the context in which our test will execute. We
create a Publisher to test.  We create a mock Subscriber that should receive
the message.  We then register the Subscriber with the Publisher. Finally we
create a message object to publish.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>Mock mockSubscriber = mock(Subscriber.class);
Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
publisher.add( (Subscriber)mockSubscriber.proxy() );

final String message = "message";</pre>
</div>

<p>Next we define <i>expectations</i> on the mock Subscriber that specify the
methods that we expect to be called upon it during the test run.  We expect
the receive method to be called with a single argument, the message that will
be sent.  The <code>eq</code> method is defined in the MockObjectTestCase
class and specifies a &quot;<a href="constraints.html">constraint</a>&quot; 
on the value of the argument passed to the subscriber: 
we expect the argument to be the equal to the <var>message</var>, but not necessarily
the same object.  (jMock provides <a href="constraints.html">several constraint types</a>
that can be used to precisely specify expected argument values).
We don't need to specify what will be returned from the receive method because it has 
a void return type.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>mockSubscriber.expects(once()).method("receive").with( same(message) );</pre>
</div>

<p>We then <i>execute</i> the code that we want to test.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>publisher.publish(message);</pre>
</div>

<p>After the test has finished, jMock will <i>verify</i> that the mock 
Subscriber was called as expected.  If the expected calls were not
made, the test will fail.</p>

<p>Here is the complete test.</p>

<div class="Source Java">
<pre>import org.jmock.*;

class PublisherTest extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testOneSubscriberReceivesAMessage() {
        // set up
        Mock mockSubscriber = mock(Subscriber.class);
        Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
        publisher.add((Subscriber) mockSubscriber.proxy());
        
        final String message = "message";
        
        // expectations
        mockSubscriber.expects(once()).method("receive").with( eq(message) );
        
        // execute
        publisher.publish(message);
    }
}</pre>
</div>
