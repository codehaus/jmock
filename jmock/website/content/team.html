    <h1>The Team</h1>
    
    <p>A successful project requires many people to play many roles. 
    Some members write code or documentation, while others are valuable as 
    testers, submitting patches and suggestions.</p>
    
    <p>The team is comprised of <a href="#members">Members</a> and 
    <a href="#contributers">Contributors</a>. Members have direct access
    to the source of a project and actively evolve the code-base. 
    Contributors improve the project through submission of patches and 
    suggestions to the Members. The number of Contributors to the project 
    is unbounded. Get involved today. All contributions to the project are 
    greatly appreciated.</p>
