    <h1>Golden Rules</h1>
	
    <p>Here are some rules that we follow when developing jMock:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr>
      	<th class="Row">Test Driven</th>
      	<td>Never check in a class without associated unit tests.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      	<th class="Row">Unit Tests Always Pass</th>
      	<td>Never check a failing unit test into the CVS repository.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      	<th class="Row">Acceptance Tests Can Fail</th>
      	<td>A failing acceptance test indicates something that needs to be done: a todo item, 
      	feature request or bug report, for example.
      	It's ok to check a failing acceptance test into the CVS repository.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      	<th class="Row">Separate Acceptance and Unit Tests</th>
      	<td>Make it easy to run only the unit tests so that we can check that they pass 
      	before committing, even when acceptance tests are failing.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
