    <h1>Writing Custom Invocation Matchers</h1>
    
    <p>Invocation matchers control how a mock object matches and verifies incoming invocations 
    against expectations and stubbed behaviour.
    The jMock API is a convenient syntactic sugar for specifying how matchers are added to
    a mock object.
    Sometimes the convenient API does not allow you to specify matching rules precisely or
    flexibly enough.
    In these cases you will need to write your own invocation matcher classes.
    This article will show you how to do just that.

    <p><em>TODO: how invocation matchers are matched against incoming invocations.</em></p>
    
	<p>An invocation matcher is an object that implements the 
    <code><a href="docs/javadoc/org/jmock/core/InvocationMatcher">InvocationMatcher</a></code>
    interface. It has the following responsiblities:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>report whether it matches against an invocation
      (the <code>match</code> method).</li>
      <li>check and record information about a dispatched invocation, if required
      (the <code>invoked</code> method).</li>
      <li>verify that expected invocations have actually been received.
      (the <code>verify</code> method from the 
      <a href="docs/javadoc/org/jmock/core/Verifiable.html"><code>Verifiable</code></a>
      interface).</li>
      <li>provide a readable description to be included in test failure messages 
      (the <code>describeTo</code> method from the 
      <a href="docs/javadoc/org/jmock/core/SelfDescribing.html"><code>SelfDescribing</code></a>
      interface).</li>
      <li>report if its description is not an empty string
      (the <code>hasDescription</code> method).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In most cases, you will want to define a new matching rule that does not care if a matched
    invocation actually occurs.  Also, you should always provide
    a description for your matching rule, so the <code>hasDescription</code> method should
    always return <code>true</code>.  This common behaviour is already implemented in the
    abstract
    <a href="docs/javadoc/org/jmock/core/matcher/StatelessInvocationMatcher.html"><code>StatelessInvocationMatcher</code></a>
    class.  You can therefore define a new matching rule by extending 
    <code>StatelessInvocationMatcher</code> and defining the 
    <code>match</code> and <code>describeTo</code> methods.</p>
