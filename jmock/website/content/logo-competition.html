    <h1>Logo Competition</h1>
    <p>Don't like the jMock logo? Neither do we!  
    Think you can do better?  Prove it!</p>
    
    <p>We need a new logo for the jMock site and other publicity material
    but none of us are graphic designers. Therefore we're holding a competition
    to choose the design of the new logo.  To enter, send us logos for both 
    <a href="http://www.jmock.org">jMock</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.nmock.org">nMock</a> sites in a SVG, Postscript or PDF
    format and we will choose our favourite.
    Entries must arrive in our mailing boxes by February 28th, 2004.
    The winner must be willing to transfer copyright for the logos to
    the jMock and nMock teams.
    </p>
