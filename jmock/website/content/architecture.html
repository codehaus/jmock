    <h1>Architectural Overview</h1>

    <p>jMock has a layered architecture.  An application's tests will usually
    use the high level API, which provides a quick and convenient way to define 
    expectations and stubs.
    That high level API is syntactic sugar layered above a flexible but verbose
    core API.  The core API provides extensible framework for defining mock objects and 
    expectations compositionally.
    The high-level and core APIs both make use of some fundamental interfaces &mdash; 
    Verifiable and Constraint &mdash; and constraint classes.  Constraints are used to
    specify acceptable argument values for expected method invocations.
    </p>
    
    <p>Although a high level API makes it easy to do most common tasks, it cannot cover
    every possible eventuality.  The high level API therefore contains lets the user
    seamlessly extend the API with new constraints, expectations and stubs.  It is even
    possible to replace the high level API with something completely different, if you
    so wish.  For example, we provide an optional extension that mimics the
    "DynaMock" API that will be familiar to users of the old 
    <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com">mockobjects.com</a> library.
    Third-party APIs that are built upon the jMock core may be announced
    on and linked from the jMock website.</p>
