    <h1>Architectural Overview</h1>
    
    <img class="Float" src="layered-architecture.gif" alt="Layered Architecture Diagram" />
    
    <p>jMock has a layered architecture.  An application's tests will usually
    use a high level API that provides a quick and convenient way to define 
    expectations and stubs.
    That high level API is syntactic sugar for a flexible but verbose
    core API.  The core API provides extensible framework for defining mock objects and 
    expectations compositionally.
    The high-level and core APIs both make use of some fundamental interfaces &mdash; 
    Verifiable, Constraint &mdash; and constraint classes.  Constraints are used to
    specify acceptable argument values for expected method invocations.
    </p>
    
    <p>Although it makes it easy to do most common tasks, a high level API cannot cover
    ever possible eventuality.  The high level API therefore contains hooks with which
    a user can access the core API to add custom expectations and stubs if necessary.</p>
    
    <h2>High Level APIs</h2>
    
    <p>jMock ships with two high-level APIs: 
    <a href="docs/javadoc/org/jmock/dynamock/package.html">DynaMock</a>, 
    which will be familiar 
    to users of the old <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com">mockobjects.com</a> 
    library, and <a href="docs/javadoc/org/jmock/hotmock/package.html">Hot Mock</a>, 
    a new API designed to be expressive and easier to read than DynaMock.  
    Other high level APIs can be implemented separately by using the core jMock 
    framework.  Third-party APIs that are built upon the jMock core may be announced
    on and linked from the jMock website.</p>
