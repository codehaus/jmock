<h1>Stubs, Expectations and the Dispatch of Mocked Methods</h1>

<p>In jMock, stubs and expectations are basically the same thing. A stub is just an
expectation of zero or more invocations. The <code>stubs()</code>
method is syntactic sugar to make the intent of the test more explicit.</p>

<p>When a method is invoked on a mock object, the mock object searches for
through its expectations in a last-in-first-out to find one that matches the
invocation. After the invocation, the matching expectation might stop matching
further invocations. E.g. an <code>expects(once())</code> expectation only matches
once.
If you set up the same expectation <var>n</var> times, the method can be
called <var>n</var> times, and the "will" actions of those expectations will
be executed in LIFO order.
</p>

<p>This scheme allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up default stubs in your the <code>setUp</code> method of your test class
  and override some of those stubs in individual tests.</li>
  <li>Set up different expectations for the same method with different action per
  invocation.  However, it's better to use the <code>onConsecutiveCalls</code>
  method to do this, as described below.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are some possible &quot;gotchas&quot; caused by this scheme:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you create an expectation and then a stub for the same method, the
    stub will always override the expectation and the expectation will never
    be met.</li>
  <li>if you create a stub and then an expectation for the same method, the
    expectation will match, and when it stops matching the stub will be used
    instead, possibly masking test failures.</li>
  <li>if you create different expectations for the same method, they will be
    invoked in the opposite order than that in which they were specified, rather
    than the same order.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best thing to do is <em>not</em> set up multiple expectations and
stubs for the same method with exactly the same matchers. Instead, use the
<tt><code>onConsecutiveCalls</code></tt> method to create multiple actions
for a method. For example:</p>

<div class="Java Source">
<pre>mock.expects(atLeastOnce()).method(m).with(...)
   .will( onConsecutiveCalls(
       returnValue(10),
       returnValue(20),
       throwException(new IOException("end of stream")) ) );</pre>
</div>
