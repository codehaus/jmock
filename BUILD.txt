In general, you are advised to compile and test directly from your IDE.  To use Ant, the 
CLASSPATH must be set up to the include the following entries to allow Ant to run the 
test targets:

    lib/*.jar
    build/core
    build/cglib

Useful targets are:
    jars            Builds the binary and source distributions into the build/dist directory
    core.jar        Builds a binary JAR of the Core jMock library into the build/dist/jars directory
    cglib.jar       Builds a binary JAR of the CGLIB extension into the build/dist/jars directory
    test            Runs the unit and acceptance tests
    test.unit       Runs the unit tests
    test.acceptance Runs the acceptance tests
    javadoc         Generates Javadoc documentation into the build/javadoc directory
